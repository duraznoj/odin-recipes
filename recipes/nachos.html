    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my favorite recipe for nachos. 
      Some say you can't make bad nachos but any true nacho-connoisseur 
      knows there is a right and a wrong way to make these delicious treats.
      <em>(Disclaimer - I have not actually tried this nacho recipe - Nachos are 
      actually very simple and a good nacho is like jazz - built on a solid foundation
      but rife with freedom of experimentation. <strong>Just don't commit the cardinal sin 
      of not melting the cheese</strong>.)</em>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 (15-oz.) can refried beans</li>

      <li>1 large tomato, diced</li>
      <li>1 avocado, diced</li>

    </ul>
      
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 425º and line a large baking sheet with foil. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add onion and cook until soft, 5 minutes, then add ground beef and cook until no longer pink, 6 minutes more. Drain fat.</li>
      <li>Add garlic and taco seasoning and season with salt. Cook until meat is well browned and slightly crispy, 5 minutes more. Add refried beans and water to skillet and stir until combined. </li>
      <li>Add half the tortilla chips and top with beef-bean mixture, half the cheese, half the black beans, and half the pickled jalapeños. Repeat one more layer.</li>
      <li>Bake until cheese is melty, 15 minutes.</li>
